# Advent of code 2023
Solutions to the problems of [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about), which is an Advent calendar in which each day contains a small programming challenge to solve in the language of your preference. 

Of course this repo won't contain well-written, super efficient code, because the idea is to complete the problem within the day, and given that I have a full time job and many other hobbies, I just want to get the result as soon as possible, without caring about errors (unless the problem specifically says so).

I chose JavaScript for solving the problems, because even though I am a C# developer, JavaScript lets me do way too much dangerous sh*t that helps me write faster (in the sense of quick to write, not quick to run) code. Everything was made using Node 18.15.0.

In each folder you will find a `Readme` file with the problem and the solution and the script that solves the problem. Inputs are not uploaded to the repository.

Happy coding!

## Why are inputs not uploaded to the repository?
As the author explicitly asked:
> I don't mind having a few of the inputs posted, please don't go on a quest to collect many or all of the inputs for every puzzle. Doing so makes it that much easier for someone to clone and steal the whole site. I put tons of time and money into Advent of Code, and the many inputs are one way I prevent people from copying the content.

## Where can I download inputs?
Just head to https://adventofcode.com/2023 and download your own inputs there. Code should work against your inputs.
