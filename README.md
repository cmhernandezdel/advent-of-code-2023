# Advent of code 2023
Solutions to the problems of [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about), which is an Advent calendar in which each day contains a small programming challenge to solve in the language of your preference. 

Of course this repo won't contain well-written, super efficient code, because the idea is to complete the problem within the day, and given that I have a full time job and many other hobbies, I just want to get the result as soon as possible, without caring about errors (unless the problem specifically says so).

I chose JavaScript for solving the problems, because even though I am a C# developer, JavaScript lets me do way too much dangerous sh*t that helps me write faster (in the sense of quick to write, not quick to run) code. Everything was made using Node 18.15.0.

In each folder you will find a `Readme` file with the problem and the solution, the input example and the script that solves the problem.

Happy coding!
